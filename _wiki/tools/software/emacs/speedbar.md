title: speedbar
---

I really don't need neotree..

Speedbar is associcated with a frame.
To create: `speedbar`.
To delete: `speedbar` again, or on speedbar frame, `q`.

* `RET`: open
* `SPC`: expand
* `b`: to buffer mode
* `f`: to file mode
* `U`: up
* `C`: copy
* `D`: delete
* `R`: rename
* `M`: create new directory

An interesting thing is,
the speedbar will always change to the folder of current buffer ..
