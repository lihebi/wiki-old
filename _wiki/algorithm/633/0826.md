# Review
## Question
How many of d(W)'s (of depth N) could be greater tha `$100*d(\lambda)$`?
## Answer
fewer than 1%. So its fewer than 2^N/100.

Fact(Ville '39):
A set of `$X \in C$` has probability 0 in the (independent)-fair-coin tossing experiment
if and only if that there is a martingale

## Intuition
A sequence S is random
if it is not an element of any probability 0 set
such that martingale d succeed on all of X.
This intuition is **WRONG**!

# Def: Computable
Let f : `${0,1}^* -> R$`

1. f is computable if there is a computable function `$\hat{f} : {0,1}* \times N->Q$`, such that , for all `$w\in \{0,1\}^*$` and precision parameter `$r \in N$`,
`$|\hat{f}(w,r) - f(w)| \leq 2^(-r)$`.
2. f is lower semi-computable
if  there is a computable function `$\hat{f} : {0,1}* \times N -> Q$`,
such that for every w, the following two condition hold:
	1. for every pationce parameter `$t \in N$`,
	`$\hat{f}(w,t)\leq \hat(w,t+1)< f(w)$`
	2. `$limit_{t ~ +\infty} \hat{f}(w,t)=f(w)$`

## Example
`$\sum_{1\leq n \in K}{1/n^2}$` is lower semi-computable but not computable.

Proof?

# Def: Random
1. A sequence r is random if there is no lower semi-computable martingale that succeeds on R
2. A sequence R is computably random if there is no computable martingale that succeeds on R
