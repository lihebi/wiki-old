# Randomness warmup
## first objective
define finite state gamblers.

## Example:

State 0: bet 0 with 0.3 and bet 1 with .7
State 1: bet 0 with 0.7 and bet 1 with .3

```
d_G(w) = money after seeing w
d_G(\lambda)=1 Initial state =0
d_G(1)=1.4
d_G(0)=0.6
d_G(11)=0.84=1.4*0.6
d_G(110)=1.176=0.84*1.4
```

# finite state gambler (FSG)
an FSG is an ordered 5-tuple

`$G=(Q,\sigma, \delta,s,\beta)$`

where

* Q is a finite set of states,
* `$\sigma$` is a finite input alphabet
* `$\delta$` : `$Q \times \sigma -> !$`
is the transition function,
s in Q is the start state.
* `$\beta$` is the betting function,
`$Q->\Delta_Q(\sigma)$` which is a rational probability measures

```
\beta(q)(a),
\beta(0)(0)=.3
```

## recursively define d_G(w):

`$d_G(wa) = d_G(w)*2*\beta(\hat{\delta}(s,w))(a)$`

where `$\hat{\delta}(s,w)$` is the state that w takes you to from initial state s.

Define a martingale on an alphabet \sigma is a function:
`$d : \sigma^* -> [0,+\infty]$`
satisfying `$d(w)= \sum_{a \in \sigma}{d(wa)}/ |\sigma|$`

d_G is a martingale

Proof:

`$\sum_{a\in \sigma}{d_G(a)}=....=d$`
