# Margingale
The definition of martingale betting system(betting strategy):
> Succeed on a sequence(inifinite binary string)

## traditional martingale
Double the bet after every loss, so the first win will recover.

Anti-martingale: reduce after a loss.
This is gambler's fallacy, and it fails to make any money.
The exception is when it is correlated to the env, say stock,
may come with a long period of continuous loss.

## Excecise
* `FIN`: a sequence wit finite number of "1"s. Define a martingale which would succeed on any of FIN.

### Answer
as there are "more" zeros than ones in a FIN, bet on zeros rather than ones.
### Example
`$d(\lambda)=1$`,
`$d(w1)=d(w)*0.5$`,
`$d(w0)=d(w)*1.5$`

Proof:

Let w be the index of the last 1 in the sequence S.
For any `$m \in N+$`,
let `$n = 3w+2[log m]$`,
`$d(S[0,1,..n-1])>m$`.
