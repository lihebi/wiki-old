Choose `$A \in {0,1}*$` at random, what is `$Prob[A \in NP | A \in Exp]$`?

Intuition:
how do we algorithmically certify that
a set `$X \in [0,1]$` has total length `$\leq \alpha$`?
X is a set of points in the interval [0,1].

Add a dimension,
`$area (X \times [0,1] ) = length (X)$`

`$length (X) \leq \alpha$`
<--> `$Areas(X \times [0,1]) \leq \alpha$`
<--> enough sand to cover X to a depth of 1
(as an ant farm) <--> enough sand to cover [0,1] to a depth of `$\alpha$`

Building a martingale,
d(w)= depth of sand in interval w after `$|w|$` steps:
length of interval w is `$\frac{1}{2^|w|}$`.

* `$d(\lambda)=\alpha$`,
* `$d(w)=\frac{d(w1)+d(w0)}{2}$`,
* `$d(w) \geq 0$`,

is a martingale.

If `$\alpha$` is arbitrarily small,
and we still are able to build such a martingale,
we algorithmically certify that??

# Assignment

1. Given an example of a infinite set `$X \in {0,1}^{\infty}$`
that seems to be small
(has probability zero in the independent fair coin tossing game),
prove that it does by defining a martingale d that succeed on every element of X.

2. Do (1), challenging others in the class to find the martingale

3. _optional_ Try to do this with an uncountable set X
