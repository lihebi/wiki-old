# Just A Buffer

* `MIPS`: million instructions per second.
* `MIPS-year`: the number of instructions executed during one year of computing at 1M instructions/sec.
* `Fan-out`: the maximum number of digital inputs that the output of a single logic gate can feed.
* `K-ary tree`: rooted tree in which each node has no more than k children.
* `Shared nothing architecture`: a distributed architecture in which each node is independent and self-sufficient. In particular, none of the nodes share memory of disk.
* `Endianness`: Big-endian store MSB of a word in the **smallest** address. The memory grows up down, so small address is up.
