# Virtual vs. Non-Virtual

Without `virtual` you get **early binding**. Which implementation of the method is used gets decided at **compile time based on the type of the pointer that you call through**.

With `virtual` you get **late binding**. Which implementation of the method is used gets decided at **run time based on the type of the pointed-to object** - what it was originally constructed as. This is not necessarily what you'd think based on the type of the pointer that points to that object.

```cpp
class Base
{
public:
  void Method1 ()  {  std::cout << "Base::Method1" << std::endl;  }
  virtual void Method2 ()  {  std::cout << "Base::Method2" << std::endl;  }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
  void Method1 ()  {  std::cout << "Derived::Method1" << std::endl;  }
  void Method2 ()  {  std::cout << "Derived::Method2" << std::endl;  }
};

Base* obj = new Derived ();
//  Note - constructed as Derived, but pointer stored as Base*

obj->Method1 ();  //  Prints "Base::Method1"
obj->Method2 ();  //  Prints "Derived::Method2"
```

# Virtual vs. Pure Virtual

* virtual function `can` be overriden
* the pure virtual `must` be implemented in non-abstract class
