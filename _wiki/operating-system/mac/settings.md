* to set default application for openning a kind of file:

How to use a target display mode(TDM)
=====================================

* apple has a help page
* not all mac supports it
* Only apple's keyboard can use `cmd-F2` to switch.
It is actually not `cmd-F2`, but `cmd-brightnessup`
* But, use Karabiner:
`change F1..F19 Key & Functional Key (Brightness Control ...)` =>
`Change F1...F19 Key` =>
enable `F1,F2 to Brightness Adjust`.
Then every keyboard can use `cmd-F2` to switch.
* There're no method known to switch without connecting keyboard to the iMac.
* One more thing: to make Karabiner to be in effect, you must log in!
