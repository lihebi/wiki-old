## Euclidean space

欧几里得空间，欧式空间，内积空间

V是欧几里德空间当:
g是V上的二元实值函数, x,y,z是V上任意向量, k是实数

1. g(x,y) = g(y,x)
2. g(x+y,z) = g(x,z) + g(y,z)
3. g(kx,y) = kg(x,y)
4. g(x,x) >= 0, 且g(x,x)=0 if and only if x=0

## Property
* distributive: a(b+c) = ab + ac

## statistic
* Latent variable: variables that are not directly observed but are rather inferred
* DAG: directed acyclic graph
### Bayesian
* Bayesian network:
a probabilistic graphical model
that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies
via a directed acyclic graph.
### Markov
* Markov process:
* Stochastic process(random process):
a collection of random variables,
representing the evolution of some system of random values over time.
* Markov property:
_memoryless property of a stochastic process_.
A stochastic process has the Markov property if
the conditional probability distribution of future states of the process
(conditional on both past and present states)
depends **only upon the present state**,
not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
* strong Markov property:
### Probability
* Probability space(probability triple):
a mathematical construct that models a real-world process(or "experiment")
consisting of states that occur randomly.
  - A sample space, Ω, which is the set of all possible outcomes.
  - A set of events `F`, where each event is a set containing zero or more outcomes.
  - `P`: The assignment of probabilities to the events
* Markov chain: a markov process.
